Siegfried is a Twitter client written with XUL. I think it requires
Firefox 3 or whichever version of Gecko that corresponds with. I wrote
it mostly to learn how XUL works, so it's a bit rough around the edges.

How to get it running:

If you have xulrunner:

xulrunner application.ini

A little bird told me (haha, because it's Twitter, get it?) you can
use Firefox to run it too:

firefox -app application.ini
